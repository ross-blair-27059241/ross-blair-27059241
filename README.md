# Whoami

I'm a Security Engineer with 5 years working experience in intrusion detection and security-incident response operations.  I currently work on architecting, building, and improving the systems and threat-detections that SOC and IR Teams use to defend companies.

The knowledge and skills that I have, as well as those that I am currently developing, are all focused on helping companies with highly decentralized IT infrastructures, with large application deployments through "Infrastructure-as-a-Service" providers (e.g. AWS EC2, S3, EKS, etc.) and multiple "Software-as-a-Service" dependencies (e.g. GitHub for CI/CD, Slack for company communications, etc.).


## Cryptographic Verification of My Work

I sign all my commits as well as certain important documents \(including this README\) with my personal OpenPGP standard \(PGP\) key-certificate.  This PGP key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key bares the PGP fingerprint `5089 BF57 0395 FA05 9380  BC80 2C19 753D B797 5FDF`.  It's available via Github API [here](https://api.github.com/users/ross-blair-27059241/gpg_keys) or direct download [here](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241/ross-blair-27059241).

You can doubly verify the authenticity of this key by verifying that the fingerprint of the downloaded GPG public key \(mentioned above\) is the same as the GPG public key fingerprint specified in my X \(formerly Twitter\) account profile: `@rb_27059241`.

I intend to have an unbroken pattern of verified commits on my code and content contributions.


## Contacting Me

For now, the best way to reach out to me is via direct message \(DM\) [on my X \(formerly Twitter\) account](https://twitter.com/rb_27059241).  I should mention that my responses may be very delayed as I am not a daily user of this platform.

> To verify the authenticity of this document with this written signature here, please first refer to the following three peices of information:
>
>   1. The document file which you are reading at this very moment, referred to in this context as the "source file".
>   2. The GPG-public-key-detached-signature-file corresponding to the source file, often referred to as the "signature file".  The signature file bares the same name as its source file plus a ".sig" suffix.  The signature file can be located in the same directory as this source file.
>   3. The OpenPGP standard \(PGP\) key-certificate belonging to the source file's author: [Ross Blair](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241).  The PGP key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key bares the PGP fingerprint `5089 BF57 0395 FA05 9380  BC80 2C19 753D B797 5FDF`.  Available via Github API [here](https://api.github.com/users/ross-blair-27059241/gpg_keys) or direct download [here](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241/ross-blair-27059241).

> To doubly verify the authenticity of this PGP key-certificate you've just retrieved \(mentioned above in step 3\), check that the PGP fingerprint of that key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key is the same as that fingerprint specified in the account profile of Ross Blair's X \(formerly Twitter\) account: `@rb_27059241`.
>
> With these peices of data/information, and the authenticity of the PGP public key-certificate confirmed, you can move on to the final step of truly verifying this signed document. Download and install the application [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/index.html) - or a derivative program like [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org). Then use this program to to verify that this file was indeed signed by the holder of the PGP private key corresponding to Ross Blair's PGP public key.  There are two technical steps to this process:
>   1. Import Ross Blair's PGP public key-certificate to your GPG program's keystore.  Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --import [public-key-file]`.
>   2. Finally, verify Ross Blair's signature on this document. Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --verify [signature-file-name] [source-file-name]`.
>
> The resulting message from the GPG program on your command line should confirm that the signature is valid, and that this signed document is authentic.
