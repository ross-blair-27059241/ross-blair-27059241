# 2025-04-25 Notice of a New IKC Issued to Ross Blair for Arkastala Security Work

As I work on the instantiation of Arkastala Security LLC's GitHub organization and infrastructure, I've generated a second PGP individual-key-certificate \(IKC\) that will serve as the identifier for my Arkastala Security related work.  The following is that IKC's public key-certificate data:

```
pub   rsa4096/0x3396C234599651AE 2025-04-21 [C] [expires: 2027-04-21]
      Key fingerprint = 3D50 49FD 19D8 A2F3 C37D  CDE8 3396 C234 5996 51AE
uid                   [ultimate] Ross Blair | Arkastala Security LLC (Arkastala Security LLC OpenPGP standard [PGP] key-certificate for Ross Blair.) <no_reply.people.pgp_key_certs@arkastala.com>
sub   rsa4096/0x2EF7FE8BC660C094 2025-04-21 [S] [expires: 2027-04-21]
      Key fingerprint = 38A9 7216 F97F CF41 C00C  0802 2EF7 FE8B C660 C094
sub   rsa4096/0xBCD94446A0F24E8C 2025-04-21 [E] [expires: 2027-04-21]
      Key fingerprint = 963E 725F D5EB 2C51 0D18  3459 BCD9 4446 A0F2 4E8C
sub   rsa4096/0x9A0E3EB69627DF5E 2025-04-21 [A] [expires: 2027-04-21]
      Key fingerprint = E24E 6DE3 4389 8191 89A5  355C 9A0E 3EB6 9627 DF5E
```

This key-certificate data will also be uploaded alongside my "Personal ID" IKC on the root directory of my GitHub profile repo.

Finally, you can see that I've cryptographically signed a copy of this notice as well as well as the IKC's public key-cert data for verification purposes.  These signatures can be found in the same directory as this notice.

> To verify the authenticity of this document with this written signature here, please first refer to the following three peices of information:
>
>   1. The document file which you are reading at this very moment, referred to in this context as the "source file".
>   2. The GPG-public-key-detached-signature-file corresponding to the source file, often referred to as the "signature file".  The signature file bares the same name as its source file plus a ".sig" suffix.  The signature file can be located in the same directory as this source file.
>   3. The OpenPGP standard \(PGP\) key-certificate belonging to the source file's author: [Ross Blair](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241).  The PGP key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key bares the PGP fingerprint `DC30 10BF 60E9 9F4F 1900  D558 B610 F59B 30E5 06F0`.  Available via Github API [here](https://api.github.com/users/ross-blair-27059241/gpg_keys) or direct download [here](https://github.com/ross-blair-27059241/ross-blair-27059241).
>
> To doubly verify the authenticity of this PGP key-certificate you've just retrieved \(mentioned above in step 3\), check that the PGP fingerprint of that key-certificate's certifying-primary-key-pair's public-key is the same as that fingerprint specified in the account profile of Ross Blair's X \(formerly Twitter\) account: `@rb_27059241`.
>
> With these peices of data/information, and the authenticity of the PGP public key-certificate confirmed, you can move on to the final step of truly verifying this signed document. Download and install the application [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/index.html) - or a derivative program like [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org). Then use this program to to verify that this file was indeed signed by the holder of the PGP private key corresponding to Ross Blair's PGP public key.  There are two technical steps to this process:
>   1. Import Ross Blair's PGP public key-certificate to your GPG program's keystore.  Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --import [public-key-file]`.
>   2. Finally, verify Ross Blair's signature on this document. Run this \(or some very similar\) CLI command: `gpg --verify [signature-file-name] [source-file-name]`.
>
> The resulting message from the GPG program on your command line should confirm that the signature is valid, and that this signed document is authentic.
